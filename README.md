# 📝 Data Cleaning Task

## 👋 About This Project  
This is my first GitHub project where I cleaned and prepared a dataset using Python (Pandas) and Jupyter Notebook.  
The raw dataset had missing values, duplicate rows, and inconsistent formats. I fixed these issues to make the dataset ready for analysis.

## 🛠️ Tools I Used  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Python  
- Pandas library   

## ✅ What I Did  
✔️ Checked and handled missing values  
✔️ Removed duplicate rows  
✔️ Made text values like gender and country consistent  
✔️ Fixed date formats to be the same (dd-mm-yyyy)  
✔️ Renamed column headers to look clean (lowercase, no spaces)  
✔️ Fixed incorrect data types (like age as number, date as date type)  

## 📁 Files in This Project  
  --netflix_titles.csv # Original dataset
  --cleaned_netflix_titles.xls # Cleaned dataset after fixing issues
  --task1.ipynb # Jupyter notebook with all my steps
  --README.md # This file

## ✅ Output  
A clean, standardized dataset ready for data analysis, free of missing values, duplicates, and formatting inconsistencies.

## 🙌 Acknowledgements  
This task is part of the **ELEVATE LABS Internship Program** aimed at building practical data handling and cleaning skills.
